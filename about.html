        <h1>About the author</h1>
        <p>
            I've been writing software professionally for a little over a decade now.  I've written software in a variety of domains (telecom, data science, manufacturing),
            formats (open source, proprietary), and languages (front-end, back-end, and everything in between).  I'm fascinated with pursuing the art of software engineering,
            tackling a wide variety of challenges from narrow performant multithreaded C++ programming to sweeping enterprise class microservices.  I generally hang out at
            the <a href="https://discord.gg/rCMKcUU">C# Inn Discord channel</a> where I am known as Ximvu#6915.

        <h1>About the blog</h1>
        <p>
            This is a space for sharing my personal writings and while the posts will cover mostly software engineering topics they may vary broadly in scope.  For the
            most part I aim to write about things as I learn them so that I can understand them better (by forcing myself to put my learning into words), share knowledge (to the
            extent these writings can be considered knowledgable), and encourage discussion (feel free to reach out to me about anything written here, doubly so if you
            can correct me).

<h1>About the site</h1>
<p>
    The site is generated with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is my first foray into making some kind of blog like this.  The styling is
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.  In addition to the CSS/JS Bootstrap provides I've leaned hevaily on their
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/blog/">examples</a>.
